2. Grant of License. In consideration of, and conditioned upon, your payment of the applicable fees to NI, NI hereby
grants you a limited, non-exclusive right to use (in accordance with one of the license types listed below) the
specific SOFTWARE, as such SOFTWARE and license type are identified in the applicable documentation
provided by NI to you, but only pursuant and subject at all times to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Unless otherwise provided in the applicable documentation provided by NI to you, the applicable license type is a
named user license as described in Section 2.A. below. While your use rights may extend to a prior version of
the SOFTWARE as expressly permitted under Section 6 below, your use rights do not extend to any Upgrades
for the applicable SOFTWARE unless such Upgrades are provided to you during the Limited Warranty period
noted below in Section 13 or are provided to you as part of the Software Service for which you have paid the
applicable fees. The SOFTWARE is in "use" when loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into
permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, network storage device, or other storage device).
Except as expressly authorized under this Section 2, floating, concurrent, or shared use is not permitted under
this Agreement. The specific use rights granted to you are as follows and depend upon the type of license you
have acquired:
A. Named User/Computer Based License. If you have acquired a named user license, you must designate in
writing (through the NI registration process) one (1) of your employees to serve as the named user for the
license (the "Named User"). The SOFTWARE may be installed on up to three computers in a single
workplace of the designated Named User. Only the designated Named User, however, may use or
otherwise run the SOFTWARE, and the SOFTWARE may not be run concurrently (i.e., it may only be
launched on one computer at a time). At your discretion, you may convert a named user license to a
computer based license. If you have acquired a computer based license or converted a named user license
to a computer based license pursuant to this Section 2.A., the SOFTWARE may only be installed and used
on one (1) computer in your workplace. In the case of a named user license, if any of the computers on
which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, notebook or similar portable computer, or, in the case of
a computer based license, if the single computer is a laptop, notebook or similar portable computer, you may
use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while temporarily away from your workplace for the same
purpose permitted by this Agreement as you normally use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while
in your workplace. While all of the SOFTWARE must be installed and used on the same computer under a
computer based license, there is no limitation on the number of your employees that may access and use
the SOFTWARE on such computer; provided, however, that the SOFTWARE may not be run concurrently
(i.e., only one instance of the SOFTWARE can be launched on one computer at a time). Regardless of
whether the SOFTWARE is used under a named user license or a computer based license, in no event may
any of the SOFTWARE be installed or used on a network storage device. If you have a VLP License or
Surviving VLP License and you want to convert named user licenses to computer based licenses, you must
give written notice to NI so that NI can send you a new license file reflecting the revised number of licenses
of each type; provided that no more than four (4) such conversions may occur per calendar year. You may
transfer a named user license to another designated employee provided that no more than four (4) such
transfers may occur per calendar year. You may change the designated computer for a computer based
license to another computer within the applicable single workplace; provided that no more than four (4) such
changes may occur per calendar year and further provided that, immediately following such change, none of
the SOFTWARE remains installed on the previously designated computer. Once the named user license for
a designated Named User has been transferred to another employee or third party contractor pursuant to
Section 2.M. of this Agreement, such named user license must be reregistered with NI to designate the new
Named User. Unless otherwise specified by NI in writing, deployment licenses you have acquired in
connection with any of the SOFTWARE listed in, or otherwise identified pursuant to, Section 12.B. as being
subject to the license verification or distribution authorization requirements stated therein (each such
deployment license being referred to as a "Designated Deployment License"), are computer based licenses.
B. Volume/VLP License. If you have acquired the right to use the SOFTWARE for multiple users under the
Volume License Program ("VLP"), you shall install and use an Approved Volume License Manager with the
most current license file provided to you by NI that controls end-user access to the SOFTWARE licensed
under the VLP. During the VLP Term, you may distribute the master installation disk(s) containing the
SOFTWARE for internal installation and use by your employees only on those computers located at the
Site(s). In addition to being subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.I., your use of the
SOFTWARE under the VLP shall at all times (during the VLP Term and thereafter) also be subject to all
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement regarding the specific type of VLP License you have
acquired under the VLP. As part of the VLP, you must, for each individual VLP License, acquire and
maintain during the term of the VLP the Software Services for the SOFTWARE identified in the applicable
VLP Documentation and for which NI makes such Software Services available.
C. Enterprise Program/EP License. In some cases NI makes available licenses and services for certain
SOFTWARE to certain customers pursuant to an NI Enterprise Program ("EP"). In such cases NI, or an
authorized NI affiliate, and the customer enter into NI Enterprise Program Documentation that, among other
things, identifies the SOFTWARE items which are covered under the customer's EP; the types and
maximum number of the customers EP licenses for such SOFTWARE during the EP Term; the types and
maximum number of any licenses which the customer will obtain on expiration of the EP Term, and the
SOFTWARE to which such licenses will apply; any EP Pre-Existing Licenses to be converted to Term
licenses under the customers EP for the EP Term; the Software Services which the customer is purchasing,
and NI is providing, under the customer's EP; and the training and certification service credits which the
customer is purchasing, and NI is providing, under the customers EP. NI is not obligated to enter into, or to
authorize or cause any NI affiliate to enter into, EP Documentation with you or to make the EP or its benefits
available you. If NI, or an authorized NI affiliate, and you have entered into EP Documentation, then the
following provisions of this Section 2.C., and Section 2.J., apply, and use of the SOFTWARE is subject to
the provisions of this Section 2.C. and the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.J. You shall install and
use an Approved Volume License Manager with the most current license file provided to you by NI that
controls end-user access to the SOFTWARE licensed pursuant to the EP. During the EP Term, you may
distribute the master installation disk(s) containing the SOFTWARE for internal installation and use by your
employees only on those computers located at the EP Locations. SOFTWARE may be used under the EP:
(a) solely in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement regarding the specific type
of license applicable to such license type acquired under the EP, (b) solely at, and on computers located at,
the EP Locations, and (c) solely during the EP Term. After the expiration of the EP Term, any and all
subsequent use of the SOFTWARE which may be permitted under the EP for which the license Term had
not previously terminated shall be as provided in Section 2.J. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) in no
event may your use of the SOFTWARE (in the aggregate) under the EP exceed the maximum total number
of licenses set forth in the EP Documentation and (ii) no software (including any copies of the SOFTWARE)
other than the copies of the SOFTWARE expressly identified in the EP Documentation may be used by you
under the EP.
D. Concurrent Use License. If you have acquired a concurrent use license, you may install the SOFTWARE on
any or all computers at the Sites for use by Authorized Users at the Sites; provided, however, in no event
may the number of Authorized Users who are accessing and/or running any of the SOFTWARE at the same
time (i.e., concurrent users) exceed the Maximum Number of Seats which you have purchased. You agree
that you will also use an Approved Volume License Manager and the license file provided by NI that controls
end-user access to the SOFTWARE to ensure compliance with the foregoing. Your concurrent use license
will automatically terminate if the number of concurrent users of the SOFTWARE at any time exceeds the
Maximum Number of Seats which you have purchased. As used herein, the term "Authorized Users" means
your employees at the Sites who use the SOFTWARE; for purposes of this Section 2.D. the term "Sites"
means and is limited to only the Site (as defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) to which NI initially delivered the
SOFTWARE and all of your Sites (as defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) which are located within the same country
as that Site; and the term "Maximum Number of Seats" means the number of seats you have acquired as
designated in the applicable quote or other documents provided to you by NI. For purposes of the
concurrent use license, all Sites (as defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) which are located in a member of the North
American Free Trade Agreement or South America shall be considered located in the same country, all
Sites (as defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) which are located in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Africa or any
member country of the European Union shall be considered located in the same country, and all Sites (as
defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) which are located in Asia shall be considered located in the same country.
E. Multiple Access License. If you have acquired a multiple access license to use NI-488.2 SOFTWARE for
GPIB-ENET hardware products (individually or collectively, "Multiple Access Software"), your employees
may install and use the NI-488.2 SOFTWARE on any number of computers or storage devices in your
workplace solely for the purpose of accessing Ethernet to GPIB controllers. If any of such computers on
which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, notebook or similar portable computer, you may use the
SOFTWARE as permitted by this Section 2.E. on the portable computer while temporarily away from your
workplace.
F. Debug License. If you have acquired a debug license, you must have licensed the applicable SOFTWARE
components (as identified below) under (i) a separate named user license, computer based license, or VLP
License with NI, in which case your applicable employee(s) may now, under the debug license, install such
SOFTWARE components on one (1) additional target production computer (for each debug license acquired)
for debug purposes only or (ii) a concurrent use license, in which case you may install and use the
SOFTWARE for debug purposes only, in accordance with the concurrent use restrictions set forth above. If
you licensed the applicable SOFTWARE components under a license other than a concurrent use license,
then each of the applicable components must be used on the same target production computer. Debug
licenses may only be used for debug purposes. In no event may you use the components for developing
new programs (e.g., test sequences/modules, virtual instruments (VIs), etc.). Further, if you acquire any
Upgrade to the applicable SOFTWARE, your existing debug license cannot be used with such Upgrade.
Rather, you must acquire a separate, "upgraded" debug license from NI for use with such Upgrade. If the
SOFTWARE is NI TestStand, then the applicable components are (a) the NI TestStand runtime execution
engine for executing your sequences and the complete NI TestStand sequence editor development
environment; (b) one (1) copy of LabVIEW and the applicable software toolkits; (c) one (1) copy of
LabWindows/CVI and the applicable software toolkits; and (d) one (1) copy of Measurement Studio and the
applicable SOFTWARE toolkits. If the SOFTWARE is LabVIEW, then the applicable component is one (1)
copy of LabVIEW and the applicable SOFTWARE toolkits. If the SOFTWARE is LabWindows/CVI, then the
applicable component is one (1) copy of LabWindows/CVI and applicable SOFTWARE toolkits. If the
SOFTWARE is NI SwitchExecutive, then the applicable component is one (1) copy of NI SwitchExecutive. If
the SOFTWARE is Measurement Studio, then the applicable component is one (1) copy of Measurement
Studio and the applicable SOFTWARE toolkits. If the SOFTWARE is any of the following software, or any
other software designated by NI as being software with respect to which NI offers a debug license: LabVIEW
Mobile Module, LabVIEW Touch Panel Module, LabVIEW Real-Time Module, LabWindows/CVI Real-Time
Module, LabVIEW FPGA Module, LabVIEW Control Design and Simulation Module, Vision Development
Module, LabVIEW Statechart Module, LabVIEW DSC Module, or LabVIEW DSP Module); ("Designated
Software"), then the applicable component is one (1) copy of such Designated Software.
G. Academic Licenses.
(1.) Student Edition License. If the SOFTWARE is a student edition (including SOFTWARE acquired
pursuant to a student install option license), you must (i) be a Student or an Instructor; (ii) have acquired
a student edition license; (iii) only, if you are a Student, use the SOFTWARE for your personal
education purposes and not for any other purpose, including research, professional, commercial, or
industrial purposes; and (iv) only, if you are an Instructor, use the SOFTWARE for your preparation for
classroom or lab coursework and not for any other purpose, including use in a classroom or lab,
research, professional, commercial, or industrial purposes. The SOFTWARE may be installed on up to
three computers. However, only you may use or otherwise run the SOFTWARE, and the SOFTWARE
may not be run concurrently (i.e., it may only be launched on one computer at a time). In no event may
any of the SOFTWARE be installed or used on a network storage device. You hereby understand and
agree that your license will automatically expire upon the conclusion or termination of your enrollment in
an Academic Institution (or, in the case of student install option licenses, upon the conclusion or
termination of your enrollment at the Academic Institution from which you obtained such license) or
should you stop being an Instructor unless otherwise expressly specified by NI or its affiliates in writing;
upon any such expiration, you must promptly uninstall all copies of the SOFTWARE. As stated in
Section 5 below (without limiting the generality thereof), academic licenses, including student edition
licenses, may not be transferred.
(2.) Primary and Secondary School License. If you have acquired a primary and secondary school license,
you may use the SOFTWARE solely for educational purposes in your primary and secondary school.
Primary and secondary schools are defined as levels K12 and International Standard Classification of
Education (ISCED) levels 03. You may install the SOFTWARE on no more than the number of your
school's computers specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer documents. If any of
the number of computers on which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, notebook or similar
portable computer, you may use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while temporarily away from
your institutions classroom, lab, or other facilities for the same purpose permitted by this Agreement as
you normally use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while in such facilities. The foregoing rights
apply to a single school or campus and do not extend to an entire school district. You may distribute
Authorized Applications created with the SOFTWARE that is properly installed on computers located
within your campus, school, or department as indicated in the applicable quote or other offer documents;
provided that (i) you comply with all the terms and conditions in this Agreement regarding distribution of
Authorized Applications and (ii) such distribution, and subsequent use of such Authorized Applications,

your only distribution rights under a primary and secondary school license. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event may you distribute any applications (including code such as
VIs and executables) created with the SOFTWARE other than as expressly permitted in this Agreement.
Any use of the SOFTWARE under a primary and secondary school license by any person who is not a
student or teacher at your primary or secondary school or any use for research, commercial, or
industrial purposes is expressly prohibited.
(3.) Academic Teaching License. If you have acquired an academic teaching license, you may use the
SOFTWARE solely for instructional purposes in your department, college, or on a specific university
campus, in each case, of an Academic Institution, depending on the option selected in the applicable
purchase order submitted to NI. A use will be considered as one for "instructional purposes" only if such
use meets either of the following criteria: (i) a common exam is given to Students at the end of a
semester or other academic period and the exam relates (in whole or part) to the Students' use of the
SOFTWARE or (ii) homework or similar projects requiring the use of the SOFTWARE are used for
grading in lieu of an exam. You may install the SOFTWARE on no more than the number of your
Academic Institution's computers (located within the applicable department, college, or specific
university campus) specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer documents. If any of
the number of computers on which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, notebook or similar
portable computer, you may use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while temporarily away from
your institutions classroom, lab, or other facilities for the same purpose permitted by this Agreement as
you normally use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while in such facilities. You may distribute
Authorized Applications created with the SOFTWARE, provided, however, that (i) you comply with all
the terms and conditions in this Agreement regarding distribution of Authorized Applications and (ii)
such distribution, and subsequent use of such Authorized Applications, is for academic purposes only.
Except for the foregoing limited distribution right, in no event may you distribute any software
deliverables created with the SOFTWARE under an academic teaching license without the prior written
approval of NI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any use of the SOFTWARE by any
person who is not a Student or Instructor at your Academic Institution or any use for research,
commercial, or industrial purposes under this Agreement is prohibited.

licenses, NI will deliver to you the master installation disks for the applicable Student Edition
SOFTWARE. You may make the applicable Student Edition SOFTWARE available only to (i) no more
than the number of Students specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer documents
and (ii) Students that are currently enrolled at the applicable department, college, or specific university
campus of your Academic Institution specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer
documents. All use of the SOFTWARE under a student install option license shall be in accordance with
the student edition license terms and conditions above. The applicable student install option license will
automatically expire upon the conclusion or termination of the applicable Student's enrollment at your
Academic Institution; upon any such expiration, the Student must promptly uninstall all copies of the
SOFTWARE. As stated in Section 5 below (without limiting the generality thereof), academic licenses,
including Student Install Option licenses, may not be transferred (including to other Students or to
another Academic Institution).
(5.) Academic Research Option. If you have acquired an academic research license, you may use the
SOFTWARE solely for academic research, teaching, and educational purposes in your department,
college, or on a specific university campus, in each case, of an Academic Institution, depending on the
option selected in the applicable purchase order submitted to NI. You may install the SOFTWARE on no
more than the number of your computers specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer
documents. If any of the number of computers on which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop,
notebook or similar portable computer, you may use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while
temporarily away from your institutions classroom, lab, or other facilities for the same purpose
permitted by this Agreement as you normally use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while in
such facilities. You may distribute Authorized Applications created with the SOFTWARE; provided,
however, that (i) you comply with all the terms and conditions in this Agreement regarding distribution of
Authorized Applications; and (ii) such distribution and subsequent use is for academic purposes only.
Except for the foregoing limited distribution right, in no event may you distribute any software
deliverables created with the SOFTWARE under an academic research license without the prior written
approval of NI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any use of the SOFTWARE for
commercial or industrial purposes under this Agreement is prohibited. You must purchase Software
Service for the SOFTWARE to maintain the license.
H. Evaluation License; Pre-Release Software. If you have acquired an evaluation license, you may install and
permit your employees to use the SOFTWARE on computers in your workplace for internal evaluation
purposes only. If the computers are laptop, notebook or similar portable computers, you may use the
SOFTWARE on the portable computers while temporarily away from your workplace for internal evaluation
purposes only in the same manner as you would normally do so on the portable computers while in your
workplace. You will be deemed to have an evaluation license for all SOFTWARE that has been provided to
you by NI and for which you do not have a written document from NI expressly designating the type of
license granted to you for the SOFTWARE. The evaluation license is for your own internal use only.
Therefore, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, you may not distribute or transfer any
applications you create with the SOFTWARE under an evaluation license. You also agree to use reasonable
efforts to provide feedback to NI regarding your use of the SOFTWARE, including promptly reporting to NI
errors or bugs that you might find. Any such feedback you disclose to NI, including any changes or
suggested changes to NI's current or future products and services (collectively "Feedback"), shall be
received and treated by NI on a non-confidential and unrestricted basis, notwithstanding any restrictive or
proprietary legends to the contrary accompanying or otherwise associated with the Feedback. You hereby
grant to NI a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable license to use, copy, and
modify Feedback for any purpose, including incorporation or implementation of such Feedback into NI
products or services, and to display, market, sublicense and distribute Feedback as incorporated or
embedded in any product or service distributed or offered by NI. You also acknowledge and agree that the
SOFTWARE IS EVALUATION ONLY AND/OR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. AS SUCH, THE
SOFTWARE MAY NOT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. NI WILL NOT UPDATE THE SOFTWARE, NOR
WILL NI SUPPORT THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN CODE THAT WILL, AFTER A
CERTAIN TIME PERIOD, DEACTIVATE THE SOFTWARE AND RENDER THE SOFTWARE UNUSABLE.
ALTHOUGH THE SOFTWARE MAY WARN YOU OF THE TIME-FRAME IN WHICH IT WILL BE
DISABLED, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY BE DEACTIVATED OR
RENDERED UNUSABLE WITH OR WITHOUT WARNING. Upon such deactivation, this Agreement will be
considered terminated. Prior to deactivation of the SOFTWARE, you may contact NI to convert your
evaluation license for the SOFTWARE to a named user license or computer based license, under such
terms, and to the extent, if any, that NI generally makes such licenses available for the SOFTWARE, or such
other license as NI may (in its sole discretion) permit by paying to NI the applicable license fee and obtaining
from NI the applicable authorization code(s). NI may (in its sole discretion and upon notice to you) terminate
the evaluation license at any time, whereupon this Agreement will be considered terminated. If the
SOFTWARE consists of pre-release SOFTWARE and is also covered by an alpha/beta license (the "Beta
Agreement") between you and NI, the terms and conditions of the Beta Agreement, which are incorporated
herein by reference, shall also apply to your use of the SOFTWARE. In the event of a conflict between this
Agreement and the Beta Agreement, the terms of the Beta Agreement shall control.
I. VLP Notes. The following applies to the VLP (Volume License Program):
(1.) Program Requirements. You shall designate a separate Software Administrator for each Site and shall
promptly notify NI in writing of any changes to the Software Administrator(s). In order to participate in
the VLP, the VLP Licenses that you maintain during the VLP Term must at all times include a minimum
of five (5) copies (in the aggregate) of a version of the SOFTWARE which is considered by NI to be a
development version of a single NI SOFTWARE product. NI will deliver the master installation disks for
the SOFTWARE and, if provided for in the applicable written quotation from NI, make available the NI
VLM to the Software Administrator(s). You are responsible for ensuring that an Approved Volume
License Manager, together with the most current license file provided by NI that controls end-user
access to the SOFTWARE, (to the extent NI has made the SOFTWARE compatible with an Approved
Volume License Manager) is in use at all times with the SOFTWARE licensed under the VLP (during
the term of the VLP and thereafter). If the Approved Volume License Manager is the NI VLM or if NI
makes documentation available for the applicable Approved Volume License Manager, such Approved
Volume License Manager shall be installed and used in accordance with the documentation provided by
NI. If you have existing individual, computer based or named user licenses for the SOFTWARE that are
to be covered by the VLP, (i) you shall notify NI in writing of the product, platform, and serial number
information for each such license; (ii) each such license shall (as of the VLP Effective Date) no longer
be in effect and shall be superseded by the VLP; (iii) all individual serial numbers for each such license
shall be cancelled and replaced by a single, common serial number assigned to the VLP and the
corresponding VLP Licenses; and (iv) should you later desire to obtain individual serial numbers for any
of the VLP Licenses, you will be required to pay NI its then current fee for a conversion from a VLP
License to an individual named user license, computer based license, debug license or Measurement
Studio compile-only license having an individual serial number. Regarding Software Service, NI
reserves the right to restrict Software Service to the then most current version of the SOFTWARE that is
commercially available. You understand that NI may not make available Software Service for all
SOFTWARE available under the VLP.
(2.) Activity Compliance Logs. In addition to the submission requirement in sub-section (4.) below, you are
required to provide an Activity Compliance Log for each Site to NI promptly (but in no event later than
fifteen (15) days) following (i) the annual anniversary of the VLP Effective Date during the VLP Term
and (ii) the VLP Termination Date. NI may, upon notice to you, inspect the Site(s) and applicable
records in order to verify the accuracy of the Activity Compliance Logs. You shall pay any verified
underpayments to NI within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written notice of such underpayments. Further,
if you have underpaid, NI may require you to pay for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs actually
incurred by NI in verifying the underpayment.
(3.) Purchase Orders; Invoices. You shall submit purchase orders to NI as follows:
a. in the amount of the Activation Fee within the time-frame specified in the quote provided by NI to
you for the VLP;
b. in the amount of the Additional VLP Fees prior to the end of the then current VLP Term as set forth
below; and
c. in the amount of the VLP Renewal Fees prior to the end of the then current VLP Term as set forth
below if you desire to renew the VLP.
You are required to obtain and maintain Software Services for each VLP License for which Software
Services are made available by NI. The Software Services are charged on an annual basis and, for VLP
Licenses added during the VLP Term, will only be pro-rated on a quarterly basis (based on the quarter
of the VLP Term in which the SOFTWARE under such VLP License was first used), or such shorter
basis as NI may designate, if a purchase order is submitted to NI prior to the date the SOFTWARE for
the Additional VLP License is installed or otherwise used. All invoices shall be paid within thirty (30)
days of the date you receive them.
(4.) VLP Term. The initial term of the VLP will start on the VLP Effective Date and continue for a period of
one (1) year (the "Initial VLP Term"). You may renew the VLP for additional one (1) year periods (the
Initial VLP Term and each such renewal term, each herein referred to herein as a "VLP Term"). Should
you desire to renew the VLP for an additional one (1) year period, you must provide a current Activity
Compliance Log to NI at least sixty (60) days before the end of the then current VLP Term so that the
number of VLP Licenses for the SOFTWARE may be determined. NI will then provide you with a quote
for Software Services, any Additional VLP Fees that are applicable, and any new VLP Licenses that you
request for the renewal VLP Term (the "VLP Renewal Fee"). The VLP will be renewed for an additional
one (1) year period each time you issue to NI a purchase order for the VLP Renewal Fees prior to the
end of the then current VLP Term. You shall promptly notify NI if the information in the Activity
Compliance Log regarding the number of VLP Licenses changes following your submission, and NI
reserves the right to revise the VLP Renewal Fee (as applicable) to reflect Additional VLP Licenses
used and not reflected in the applicable Activity Compliance Log that you provided to NI at the time you
desired to renew. IF, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT VLP TERM, YOU DO NOT
ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE SOFTWARE SERVICES AND ANY ADDITIONAL VLP
FEES THAT ARE DUE (I) THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE
CURRENT VLP TERM; (II) ALL SOFTWARE SERVICES FOR THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY
AND IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT VLP TERM; AND (III)
YOU MAY NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE NUMBER OF VLP LICENSES FOR WHICH YOU
HAVE PAID THE REQUIRED FEES TO NI. UPON TERMINATION OF THE VLP, NI WILL ATTEMPT
TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATED LICENSE FILE AND YOU MAY CONTINUE TO USE THE
VLP LICENSES IN EFFECT (AND FOR WHICH YOU HAVE PAID THE REQUIRED FEES TO NI)
PRIOR TO THE DATE OF TERMINATION (THE "SURVIVING VLP LICENSES"); PROVIDED THAT
ALL SUCH USE IS CONDUCTED WITH AN APPROVED VOLUME LICENSE MANAGER (USING
THE LICENSE FILE PROVIDED BY NI FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE VLP) AND IS
CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING
THE PROHIBITIONS ON TRANSFER AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 5 BELOW). IN NO EVENT MAY
YOU INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THE SURVIVING VLP LICENSES FOLLOWING THE
TERMINATION OF THE VLP. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSE FILE
FROM NI AND TO INSTALL AND USE THE LICENSE FILE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER
DELIVERY OF SUCH LICENSE FILE FROM NI, BUT IN NO EVENT LATER THAN SIXTY (60) DAYS
AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE VLP. THE SOFTWARE AND THE APPROVED VOLUME
LICENSE MANAGERS MAY CONTAIN CODE THAT WILL, FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF THE
VLP, DEACTIVATE YOUR ABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE UNDER THE VLP. ALTHOUGH THE
NI VLM MIGHT ATTEMPT TO WARN YOU OF THE TIME-FRAME IN WHICH YOUR ABILITY TO
ACCESS AND USE THE SOFTWARE WILL BE DISABLED, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE
THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DEACTIVATED OR RENDERED UNUSABLE
WITH OR WITHOUT WARNING UPON THE TERMINATION OF THE VLP. ANY REACTIVATION OF
THE VLP FOLLOWING ITS TERMINATION SHALL BE AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF NI AND
MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE PAYMENT OF APPLICABLE REACTIVATION FEES AS DETERMINED
BY NI. SHOULD YOU AT ANY TIME DESIRE TO OBTAIN INDIVIDUAL SERIAL NUMBERS FOR
ANY OF THE VLP LICENSES OR SURVIVING VLP LICENSES, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY
NI ITS THEN CURRENT FEE FOR A CONVERSION FROM A VLP LICENSE OR A VLP SURVIVING
LICENSE (AS APPLICABLE) TO (AS APPLICABLE) AN INDIVIDUAL NAMED USER LICENSE,
COMPUTER BASED LICENSE, DEBUG LICENSE OR MEASUREMENT STUDIO COMPILE-ONLY
LICENSE HAVING AN INDIVIDUAL SERIAL NUMBER. SHOULD YOU LATER DESIRE TO OBTAIN
UPGRADES FOR THE SOFTWARE OR PURCHASE AVAILABLE SOFTWARE SERVICES FOR
THE SOFTWARE, YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY NI AN APPLICABLE FEE FOR EACH SUCH
SURVIVING VLP LICENSE.

J. EP Notes. The following applies to the EP (Enterprise Program):
(1.) EP Services. The specific services that NI will provide to you under the EP are designated in the EP
Documentation, and may include Software Services and Training & Certification Services as described
below. With respect to the specific services listed below, the following shall apply:
a. Training & Certification Services. If the services to be provided under your EP include Training &
Certification Services, you may use available Training Credits during the EP Term as you desire for
your employees to attend applicable training classes regarding the use of the SOFTWARE and/or
to receive applicable "certification preparation" courses and certification testing services from NI.
Available training classes may, unless otherwise noted, be attended on-line, attended at the
corporate training facilities of NI, or may be conducted on-site at the Training Location(s) identified
in your EP Documentation. Unless expressly agreed to in writing by NI, however, training classes
may not be attended under the EP at training centers operated by third parties, even if such third
parties are approved by NI to provide training. Although NI may provide a training schedule which
lists applicable training classes that are available as of the EP Effective Date, the training schedule
is subject to change at any time without notice to reflect changes in available dates and to include
new classes or to remove or modify previously listed classes; provided, however, that the number
of Training Credits required to attend an available course shall not change during the EP Term.
Attendance at on-line training classes is subject to availability of applicable on-line seats. Training
classes to be conducted at the Training Location(s) or at the corporate training facilities of NI are
subject to availability of instructors and must be scheduled at least thirty (30) days in advance.
There shall be no charge to you for applicable travel, lodging, and meal expenses associated with
NI instructors providing on-site training services under the EP at the Training Location(s); provided,
however, that, should you cancel a scheduled on-site training class, NI may invoice you for the
actual cost of any non-refundable travel-related expenses that NI must incur with respect to such
cancellation. Training Credits have no cash value and any unused Training Credits shall expire
upon termination or expiration of your EP Term.
b. Software Service. You shall designate a Software Administrator and shall promptly notify NI in
writing of any changes to the Software Administrator. If the services to be provided under the EP
include Software Services, then, instead of any obligation with respect to the delivery of copies of
Upgrades under a VLP, NI shall provide: (i) your Software Administrator a master copy of all
Upgrades after the applicable commercial release date and (ii) the number of your users
designated in the EP Documentation with access to NI's application engineers for issues involving
the installation and use of the SOFTWARE ("Phone Support"), and with access to NIs customer
on-line technical support system ("Web Support"), all in accordance with NIs then current standard
software maintenance and support policies. If the Support Services to be provided under the EP
include Premier Software Support Services, NI shall provide access to the Premier Software
Support Services to the number of your employees designated in the EP Documentation. NI
reserves the right to restrict Software Service to the then most current version of the SOFTWARE
that is commercially available. You understand that NI may not make available Software Service for
all SOFTWARE available under the EP.
c. No Hardware or Hardware Services. You acknowledge and agree that no hardware or
hardware-related services are being provided or otherwise made available by NI under the EP or
this Agreement.
(2.) Annual Management Review; Reports.
a. Upon such periodic basis as set forth in the EP Documentation (but at least annually), your
representatives shall meet with NIs representatives to discuss the EP and your use of the EP,
including, but not limited to, evaluating usage of the NI Software and Training Credits under the EP
and determining the adequacy of licensing levels and number of EP Location(s) under the EP.
b. You are responsible for ensuring that an Approved Volume License Manager, together with the
most current license file provided by NI that controls end-user access to the SOFTWARE, (to the
extent NI has made the SOFTWARE compatible with an Approved Volume License Manager) is in
use at all times with the SOFTWARE licensed pursuant to the EP (during the EP Term and
thereafter). If the Approved Volume License Manager is the NI VLM or if NI makes documentation
available for the applicable Approved Volume License Manager, such Approved Volume License
Manager shall be installed and used in accordance with the documentation provided by NI. Thirty
(30) days prior to the meeting referenced in sub-section (2.) a. above or upon such other
reasonable basis as NI may request, you shall provide NI with: (a) Activity Compliance Logs for
each of the EP Locations and (b) a Usage Log for the SOFTWARE at the EP Location(s) with such
Usage Log being generated by the applicable Approved Volume License Manager. NI may, upon
notice to you, inspect the Site(s) and applicable records in order to verify the accuracy of the
Activity Compliance Logs and the Usage Logs.
(3.) EP Term.
a. The "EP Term" shall have the meaning set forth below. Either NI or you may (in its discretion)
terminate the EP Term upon written notice to the other party, if such other party is in material
breach of any of its obligations under Section 2.C. or this 2.J., and has not cured such breach to
the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching party within thirty (30) days of receiving written
notice of such material breach from the non-breaching party. Further, should this Agreement, or
any of the licenses granted by NI under this Agreement, terminate because of your failure to
comply with any of the other terms of this Agreement, NI may terminate the EP Term upon
providing you with written notice of such termination. Unless mutually agreed to in writing by you
and NI, the EP Term shall not renew following the expiration of the EP Term.
b. Effect of EP Term Expiration or Termination. Upon expiration or termination of the EP Term:
(i) all use of the SOFTWARE under the EP shall immediately stop and you must destroy all
copies of the SOFTWARE, provided however that you must deliver the SOFTWARE and all
copies to NI if NI has so demanded prior to such destruction; provided, however, that
(1) with respect to the EP Pre-Existing SOFTWARE, unless the EP Term is terminated by NI
based on other than an EP-Only Breach, you may continue to use copies of such EP
Pre-Existing SOFTWARE as may be designated in the EP Documentation for post-EP
Term use, but any such post-EP Term use is permitted solely at the EP Locations and
pursuant to, and solely in accordance with, the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement regarding the specific type of license designated for such EP Pre-Existing
SOFTWARE in the EP Documentation, applicable to such license type acquired under the
VLP, and
(2) with respect to any copies of the EP Pre-Existing Software which are designated in the EP
Documentation for post-EP Term use which were either the most current version or the
immediately prior version of the SOFTWARE as of the EP Effective Date, provided that
the EP Term was not terminated by NI, you may elect to upgrade such copies to the
current version of the applicable SOFTWARE as of the effective date of termination or
expiration of the EP Term for use by you solely in accordance with sub-section (3.)b.(i)(1)
above,
but any and all rights under sub-sections (3.)b.(i)(1) and (2) above shall not apply to
copies of any SOFTWARE the license for which terminated during, or upon termination of,
the EP Term as a result of your failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement, it being
understood that any and all rights of you to use such copies would have terminated upon
such termination of such license;
(ii) you shall provide NI with the Activity Compliance Logs and Usage Logs referenced within thirty
(30) days of the effective date of such expiration or termination of the EP Term; and
(iii) you shall immediately pay to NI all amounts not paid as of the effective date of expiration or
termination of the EP Term.
IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OBTAIN ANY NECESSARY LICENSE FILES FROM NI TO ENABLE ANY
PERMITTED POST-EP TERM USE OF ANY COPIES OF EP PRE-EXISTING SOFTWARE WHICH ARE
DESIGNATED IN THE EP DOCUMENTATION FOR POST-EP TERM USE, AND TO INSTALL AND USE THE
LICENSE FILE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER DELIVERY OF SUCH LICENSE FILE FROM NI, BUT IN NO
EVENT LATER THAN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE EP TERM. THE SOFTWARE
AND THE APPROVED VOLUME LICENSE MANAGERS MAY CONTAIN CODE THAT WILL, FOLLOWING
TERMINATION OF THE EP TERM, DEACTIVATE YOUR ABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE UNDER THE EP.
ALTHOUGH THE NI VLM MIGHT ATTEMPT TO WARN YOU OF THE TIME-FRAME IN WHICH YOUR
ABILITY TO ACCESS AND USE THE SOFTWARE WILL BE DISABLED, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND
AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DEACTIVATED OR RENDERED UNUSABLE
WITH OR WITHOUT WARNING UPON THE TERMINATION OF THE EP.
(4.) EP Fees. The fees that will be charged to you in connection with the EP are set forth in the EP
Documentation. Unless specified otherwise in the EP Documentation, all annual amounts due for the
EP shall be paid by you to NI, or to the NI affiliate entering into the EP Documentation with you, within
thirty (30) days of the date of each applicable invoice. All sums not paid when due shall accrue interest
at the lesser of a monthly rate of 1.5% or the highest rate permissible by law on the unpaid balance until
paid in full. Unless set forth otherwise in the EP Documentation, all amounts to be paid by you under the
EP shall be in U.S. dollars. All fees quoted do not include applicable taxes or import/export duties. All
sales, use, transient occupancy, and excise taxes and all import, export, or other duties relating to any
deliverables provided by NI under the EP shall be your responsibility and be borne by you. All foreign,
federal, state, and local taxes, however, based upon or measured by NI's net income, property, or net
worth shall be the responsibility of and be borne by NI. If you directly or indirectly acquire a company or
business that that has 20 or more current NI software licenses, then the fees that may be charged to
you in connection with the EP will be increased.
(5.) Confidentiality. The terms of your EP Documentation, and any proposals or other documents submitted
by NI, or an authorized NI affiliate, (including all pricing and fees) in connection with your EP, and any
information about NI product development efforts provided in connection with your EP, shall be
considered the confidential information of NI and you shall not disclose such information to any third
party.
(6.) Additional Definitions. For purposes of the EP, the following capitalized terms have the following
meanings
"EP Documentation" means the NI Enterprise Program Documentation entered into between NI, or an
authorized NI affiliate, and you as described in Section 2.C.

Date so identified, the EP Effective Date is the date that the EP Documentation signed by NI is sent to
you.
"EP Locations" means your facility or facilities identified as Location(s) in your EP Documentation.
"EP-Only Breach" means your material breach of any of your obligations under Section 2.C. or this
Section 2.J. where your material breach is only a failure to comply with a term of Section 2.C. or this
Section 2.J., and is not based on, and does not also amount to, a failure to comply with any other term
of this Agreement.
"EP Pre-Existing Software" means the licenses from NI to you for the SOFTWARE covered by the EP
which were in effect immediately before the Effective Date and which are identified as Pre-Existing NI
Software in the EP Documentation.
"EP Term" means the period of time beginning on the EP Effective Date and ending upon the expiration
of the number of years thereafter stated in the EP Documentation. If no such number of years is stated
in the EP Documentation, the number of years shall be three (3). The EP Term is subject to earlier
termination as set forth above.
"Training & Certification Services" means the provision by NI, as applicable, of: (i) software training
classes and (ii) certification preparation courses and certification testing services for software of NI, in
accordance with NI's then current standard policies for software training and certification.
"Training Credits" means the number of credits listed in the EP Documentation for obtaining Training &
Certification Services.
"Training Location(s)" means those Location(s) which have been identified in the EP Documentation as

other entity, you may make and install a reasonable number of copies of the Driver Interface Software, other
than NI-VISA or NI-488.2, as may be reasonably required for your internal development of Authorized
Applications. You may not make additional copies of NI-VISA and NI-488.2 except as expressly permitted in
clause (i) of Section 10 or by NI in writing. If you received the Driver Interface Software from a third party
with or as part of an Authorized Application then you may only use the Driver Interface Software with such
Authorized Application.
L. Measurement Studio Compile-Only License. If you have acquired a Measurement Studio compile-only
license, you must have also licensed Measurement Studio under a separate named user license, computer
based license, or VLP License with NI, in which case your applicable employee(s) may now, under the
Measurement Studio compile-only license, install the Measurement Studio SOFTWARE on the number of
computers in your workplace identified in the applicable documentation provided to you by NI. There is no
limitation on the number of your employees that may access and use the Measurement Studio SOFTWARE
on such computer(s). If any of such computers on which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop,
notebook or similar portable computer, you may use the SOFTWARE as permitted by this Section 2.L on the
portable computer while temporarily away from your workplace. The Measurement Studio SOFTWARE may
be installed or used on a network storage device and the Measurement Studio SOFTWARE may be run

Authorized Application) that references the Measurement Studio libraries and was developed by you with a
license for Measurement Studio SOFTWARE that permits the development of such source code (e.g. not a
Measurement Studio compile-only license). In no event may you use the Measurement Studio compile-only
license to develop source code that references the Measurement Studio libraries (including writing code that
creates a new instance of a class defined in a Measurement Studio library or that calls a static method of a
class defined in the Measurement Studio library).
M. Third Party Contractors. If you have acquired one of the licenses set forth in Section 2.A., B., C., D., E., F.,
H., or K. above, then third party contractors that you have engaged may (if you desire) access and use the
SOFTWARE solely for your benefit; provided: (i) the contractor (or, if applicable, its employee) shall be
considered, as applicable, the Named User or Authorized User for purposes of the applicable license type,
and all use by such contractor shall be in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (ii)
before accessing the SOFTWARE, the contractor agrees in writing that (a) the SOFTWARE shall be used
solely in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and solely for your benefit and (b) the contractor shall
be liable to NI for any breach by it of this Agreement, (iii) you hereby agree and acknowledge that you will be
liable for any and all actions or omissions of the contractor with respect to the use of the SOFTWARE, as if
such actions or omissions were your own, and (iv) in the case of licenses under Section 2.C., the contractor
uses the SOFTWARE only at an EP Location.
3. License Term. This Agreement shall continue until the earlier of (i) any termination as provided in this Agreement,
or (ii) the expiration of the Agreement as set forth below.
A. Term Licenses. You hereby acknowledge and agree that this Agreement will expire automatically at the end
of the Term. However, if you have not acquired a perpetual license, subject to NIs acceptance, you may
continue the Term for an additional period by remitting the then-current applicable license fee to NI. You
hereby acknowledge and agree that the SOFTWARE may stop working and become unusable unless you
pay the license fee and, if applicable, are provided with new authorization codes. Any use of the
SOFTWARE after the Term expires will violate the terms of this Agreement. If you have purchased Software
Service, you understand and agree that the support for the SOFTWARE will only continue for the amount of
time specified in your purchase order for Software Service. After such time, you may continue to purchase
Software Service at NI's then current price, provided that Software Service is offered.
B. Perpetual Licenses. Pursuant to a perpetual license, you have the right to use the SOFTWARE indefinitely,

shall not terminate as to the EP Pre-Existing SOFTWARE described in sub-section 2.J.(3.)b.(i) by reason of
such EP-Only Breach.
D. Effect of Termination or Expiration. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, regardless of the
reason, the license grants contained herein shall terminate and you must immediately cease all use of the
SOFTWARE and all distribution of Authorized Applications, and immediately destroy all copies of the
SOFTWARE, provided however that you must deliver the SOFTWARE and all copies to NI if NI has so
demanded prior to such destruction. Sections 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, and 21, sub-section 12.A.(3.), and the
Feedback license to NI under Section 2.H., of this Agreement, shall survive any expiration or termination of
this Agreement.
4. Restrictions. You may not: (i) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE (except to the extent
such foregoing restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law); (ii) use the SOFTWARE to gain access to
unencrypted data in a manner that defeats the digital content protection provided in the SOFTWARE; (iii)
sub-license, lease, lend, or rent the SOFTWARE; (iv) (other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement)
disclose in whole or in part, distribute in whole or part, modify, or create derivatives of the SOFTWARE or
distribute or publish applications created with the SOFTWARE; (v) use the Scripting functionality to create
applications which perform the functionality of an editor for a graphical programming environment; (vi) use any
H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VC-1 technology or codecs included in or with Microsoft Silverlight software which

compliance with, or making use of, the H.264/AVC visual standard or the VC-1 video standard; (vii) take any
action that results in any of the SOFTWARE being subject to an Excluded License; or (viii) directly or indirectly,
export, re-export, download, transmit, or ship the SOFTWARE in violation of Section 21.D. or otherwise in
violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including those of the U.S., the European Union or the jurisdiction
in which you use or are downloading the SOFTWARE. Further, all uses of the SOFTWARE shall be in
accordance with the applicable documentation that accompanies the SOFTWARE and not in any manner
intended to (or that) circumvents such documentation or the intent of this Agreement. Except as expressly
permitted in Section 2, under no circumstance is "floating," shared, or concurrent use permitted under this
Agreement. Further, if you have acquired a computer based NI TestStand Development System License or NI
TestStand Custom Sequence Editor License, you may not remotely access the SOFTWARE. If you have
acquired a named user NI TestStand Development System License or NI TestStand Custom Sequence Editor
License, only the then current Named User may remotely access the SOFTWARE.
Additionally, the use of the SOFTWARE is intended only for use with content owned by the user, public domain
content or properly licensed content. You may require a patent, copyright, or other license from a third party to
create, copy, download, record or save content files for use with this SOFTWARE or to serve or distribute such
files to be used with the SOFTWARE. You agree that you shall only use the SOFTWARE and documentation in
a manner that complies with all applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which you use the SOFTWARE and
documentation, including applicable restrictions concerning copyright and other intellectual property rights. You
may not use the SOFTWARE in an attempt to, or in conjunction with, any device, program or service designed to,
circumvent technological measures employed to control access to, or the rights in, a content file or other work
protected by the copyright laws of any jurisdiction.
5. Transfer. If you have a named user license, computer based license, debug license, or if the SOFTWARE is
Multiple Access Software, you may transfer the SOFTWARE to a third party provided that you notify NI in writing
of such transfer (including the name and location of such third party), such third party accepts the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and after such transfer, you do not retain any copies of the SOFTWARE (including
all Upgrades that you may have received) nor retain any of the written materials accompanying the SOFTWARE.
NI may, in its discretion, charge you a fee for the transfer of the SOFTWARE. If you have a VLP License, a
Surviving VLP License, a concurrent use license, an academic license (including a student edition license), a
Measurement Studio compile-only, or a debug license, the license is non-transferable and you may not, without
the prior written consent of NI or its affiliates, distribute or otherwise provide the SOFTWARE to any third party or
(with respect to a VLP License or a Surviving VLP License) to any of your sites or facilities not expressly
identified in the applicable documents from NI. If you have any licenses under the EP, such licenses are
non-transferable and you may not, without the prior written consent of NI or an authorized NI Affiliate distribute or
otherwise provide the SOFTWARE to any third party or to any of your sites or facilities other than an EP
Location.
6. Upgrades; Additional Licenses for Prior Versions. If the SOFTWARE is an Upgrade, you may only use the
SOFTWARE if: (i) you have (at the time you receive the Upgrade) a valid license to use the pre-existing
SOFTWARE (the "Pre-existing License") and (ii) the Upgrade was provided to you in accordance with the
Limited Warranty noted below in Section 13 or provided to you as part of the Software Service for which you
have paid applicable fees. The license agreement accompanying the Upgrade (the "Upgrade License") applies to
your use of the Upgrade; provided, however, (i) you may only install and use the Upgrade on those computers on
which you are authorized to use the pre-existing SOFTWARE pursuant to the Pre-existing License and (ii) in no
event may you run both the Upgrade and the pre-existing SOFTWARE concurrently. Further and with respect to
any SOFTWARE delivered and licensed under this Agreement ("Delivered SOFTWARE"), you may elect to
install and use a pre-existing version of the applicable SOFTWARE (rather than the Delivered SOFTWARE);
provided, (i) you have an authorized copy of the pre-existing version of the Delivered SOFTWARE, (ii) all use will
be pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement (including the license type acquired for the Delivered
SOFTWARE), and (iii) that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall NI be
required to support any versions of the SOFTWARE (including providing applicable software key codes or
hardware keys) other than the then most current version of the Delivered SOFTWARE.
7. Home Usage Exception. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if you are a business or
other entity, the designated Named User for the applicable license (or in the case of computer based licenses,
the single individual who is the primary user of the single computer on which the SOFTWARE is installed and
used, or in the case of Academic Licenses the teachers, professors or researchers) may also install and use the
SOFTWARE on one (1) computer located in such user's home, provided that (i) the use of the SOFTWARE is
pursuant to one of the licenses enumerated in Section 2 above (other than a Designated Deployment License,
Measurement Studio compile-only license, debug license, concurrent use license, or concurrent use debug
license); and (ii) the use of the SOFTWARE on such home computer is limited to work performed in the scope of
such person's employment with you (or, in case of an Academic License, limited to the uses expressly permitted
in such applicable section) and complies with all terms and conditions of this Agreement other than as expressly
set forth in this Section. The SOFTWARE must be promptly uninstalled from the individuals home computer
upon the earlier of (a) the termination of the designated individuals employment with you, (b) the transfer of the
SOFTWARE to another Named User or change to another computer as permitted under Section 2 above, (c) the
termination or expiration of this Agreement, or (d), in the case of Academic Licenses, the teacher, professor or
researcher ceasing to be employed by the Academic Institution (whichever is earlier). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if you have a Designated Deployment License, Measurement Studio compile-only license, debug
license, concurrent use license, or concurrent use debug license, this Home Usage Exception does not apply to
you.
8. Multiple Versions (CD-ROM/DVD-ROM Media). If the SOFTWARE is distributed on a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
containing multiple versions of the SOFTWARE for use with different operating systems, you may only use one
version of the SOFTWARE. The foregoing limitation does not apply to Multiple Access Software.
9. Software/Hardware Key. If the SOFTWARE requires a software key code or a hardware key, you acknowledge
that the SOFTWARE will not function without a certain, unique software key code or hardware key. This software
key code or hardware key will be furnished to you by NI and you agree that such software key code and
hardware key is to be used solely with the SOFTWARE for which it is provided. While NI may (in its sole
discretion) provide you with the applicable key prior to receipt from you of the applicable license fees, you will
remain obligated to pay such fees to NI.
10. Copyright; No Other Licenses. The SOFTWARE, and all copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned by NI or its
suppliers and are protected by applicable copyright laws and international treaty provisions. The SOFTWARE,
and copies thereof, are licensed only, and are not sold or leased. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE like
any other copyrighted material. You may, however, (i) make a reasonable number of copies of the SOFTWARE
solely for backup or archival purposes and (ii) make a reasonable number of copies of the documentation that
accompanies the SOFTWARE solely for your internal use in connection with your use of the SOFTWARE. In no
event may you remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, or other legal notices or disclaimers that exist in
the SOFTWARE. All rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved to NI. Further, and
without limiting the foregoing, no license or any right of any kind (whether by express license, implied license, the
doctrine of exhaustion, or otherwise) is granted under any NI patents (whether identified herein or not) or other
intellectual property right of NI with respect to any other product(s) of NI or of any third party, including the right
to use any of these other products.
11. Patent and Trademark Notice. For patents covering National Instruments products, refer to the appropriate
location: Help»Patents in the SOFTWARE, the patents.txt file on the CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or ni.com/patents.
National Instruments, NI, ni.com, and LabVIEW are trademarks of National Instruments Corporation. Refer to
ni.com/trademarks for more information about National Instruments trademarks. Further, all other product and

12. Application Deployment. You may distribute, deploy or otherwise make available Authorized Applications (along
with applicable runtime engines for the SOFTWARE and applicable Driver Interface Software that you may
include as part of or together with your Authorized Applications; and along with the Microsoft Silverlight software
which may be provided by NI as Third Party Software if the Authorized Application is one created using such
Microsoft Silverlight software) provided that you comply with each of the requirements set forth in sub-sections
(A.) and (B.) below:
A. Deployment and Distribution Requirements.
(1.) You include the following copyright notice "Copyright © [insert year] National Instruments Corporation.
All Rights Reserved." in the Authorized Application's About Box (if applicable) and in (i) any applicable
written documentation or, (ii) if no such documentation exists, in a "read me" or other .txt file distributed
with each copy of the Authorized Application; (you may instead, or in addition, include your own
copyright notice with the notice(s) required above, but in no event may you remove or alter any
copyright, patent, trademark, or other legal notices or disclaimers that exist in the SOFTWARE; and,
with respect to any runtime engines for the SOFTWARE and any Driver Interface Software that you may
include as part of or together with your Authorized Application, your copyright notice shall be
understood as protecting NIs copyrights in the SOFTWARE and shall not be understood as meaning
that you have any copyright in or with respect to any SOFTWARE);
(2.) You do not use NI's name, logo, or trademarks to market your Authorized Application without NI's
express prior written permission;
(3.) You shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend NI from and against any and all claims, demands,
lawsuits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, that arise or result
from the use or distribution of your Authorized Application, AND EVEN IF DUE IN PART TO NI'S
CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO
FAULT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT YOUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OF
INDEMNIFICATION SHALL NOT EXTEND TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE CLAIMANT'S
DAMAGES OR INJURIES OR THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO NI'S
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT OR TO STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON NI AS A MATTER
OF LAW;
(4.) You conform to all of the requirements of the Third Party Software license agreements provided with the
SOFTWARE, including complying with any provisions in the Third Party Software licenses regarding
copyright notices;
(5.) The Authorized Application is not and will not consist of or include any malicious, deceptive, or unlawful
programs; and
(6.) a. If you distribute to any third parties your Authorized Application with any run-time engine for the
SOFTWARE or Driver Interface Software, you either pass through to your end users this
Agreement, or license the Authorized Application and any run-time engine for the SOFTWARE and
Driver Interface Software distributed with the Authorized Application, subject to your own license
agreement that is substantially in accordance with this Agreement and with at least the following
provisions: (i) a disclaimer of implied warranties and consequential damages in favor of you and
your licensors; (ii) a restricted rights provision substantially similar to the Section of this Agreement
entitled "U.S. Government Rights"; and (iii) restrictions against (a) reverse engineering,
decompiling, or disassembling the SOFTWARE (except to the extent such foregoing restriction is
expressly prohibited by applicable law); (b) sub-licensing, leasing, lending or renting the
SOFTWARE; (c) distributing in whole or in part, modifying, or creating derivatives of the
SOFTWARE; (d) using any H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VC-1 technology or codecs included in or
with Microsoft Silverlight software which may be provided by NI as Third Party Software, including
for the purpose of encoding or decoding video in compliance with, or making use of, the H.264/AVC
visual standard or the VC-1 video standard; (e) taking any action that results in any SOFTWARE
being subject to an Excluded License; (f) directly or indirectly, exporting, re-exporting, downloading,
transmitting or shipping the SOFTWARE in violation of Section 21.D. or otherwise in violation of
any applicable laws or regulations, including those of the U.S., the European Union or the
jurisdiction in which the SOFTWARE is used or downloaded; and (g) (if your Authorized Application
enables the use of Scripting) using the Scripting functionality to create applications which perform
the functionality of an editor for a graphical programming environment; and
b. If you distribute to any third parties your Authorized Application with Microsoft Silverlight software
which may be provided by NI as Third Party Software, then, in addition to complying with the other
requirements of this Section 12. A. (6.),
(i) you use the installer builder tool provided by NI with the SOFTWARE to create an installer for
your Authorized Application and you include the installer that NI provides for the Microsoft
Silverlight software in the installer for your Authorized Application, or you distribute your
Authorized Application with the installer that NI provides at the following URL:
http://digital.ni.com/express.nsf/bycode/InstallerForMicrosoftSilverlight, and, in either case,
you do not modify the installer that NI provides or the installer experience (including display of
the Microsoft Silverlight End User License Agreement and Privacy Statement);
(ii) you provide the "Notice About the H.264/AVC Visual Standard and The VC-1 Video Standard"
found in the Third Party Software license agreement for the Microsoft Silverlight software to
such third parties, and ensure that such Notice is provided to others who may receive a copy
of your Authorized Application with the Microsoft Silverlight software (such notice
automatically being installed via the installer that NI provides for the Microsoft Silverlight
software as described in Section 12. A. (6.) b. (i)); and
(iii) after 30 days of being notified by NI of a Critical Update to the Microsoft Silverlight software,
any new version of your Authorized Application must contain the updated version of the
Microsoft Silverlight software.
B. Fees. Generally, you may distribute, deploy or otherwise make available Authorized Applications without
paying additional fees to NI. If, however, the Authorized Application was created utilizing any of the
SOFTWARE identified in NI's Deployment Licenses listing web page, which web page is currently located at
the following URL, or any SOFTWARE added by NI at any time to such listing or any similar successor
listings: http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/9561, or such other SOFTWARE as NI may from time to
time designate, then you must (before distributing, deploying or otherwise making available the Authorized
Application for use on any other computer) either: (i) verify that the recipient has a valid license to run the
applicable Authorized Application on (or has a valid license for such SOFTWARE for) each computer on
which the Authorized Application will be used; or (ii) obtain written distribution authorization from NI and (if
required by NI) pay to NI a per copy distribution/development fee for each Authorized Application distributed,
deployed or otherwise made available. In the case of any Driver Interface Software identified as being
subject to the license verification or distribution authorization requirements stated above, if the Authorized
Application utilizes, calls, or otherwise accesses any such Driver Interface Software, the Authorized
Application shall be deemed to have been created utilizing such Driver Interface Software for purposes of
this Section 12.B.
13. Limited Warranty. Except for SOFTWARE provided under an evaluation license which SOFTWARE is provided
without warranty, NI warrants, for your benefit alone, that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date the
SOFTWARE is shipped to you (or, if downloaded, from the date the SOFTWARE is first downloaded by you) (i)
the SOFTWARE will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying documentation, and (ii) the
medium on which the SOFTWARE is recorded will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under
normal use and service ("Limited Warranty"). Any replacement SOFTWARE will be warranted for the remainder
of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow
limitations on duration of an express or implied warranty, so the above or any other limitation provided herein
may not apply to you. In such event, such warranties are limited to the minimum warranty period allowed by
applicable law. You must obtain a Return Material Authorization number from NI before returning the
SOFTWARE under warranty to NI and you agree to pay expenses for shipment to and from NI. The Limited
Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, improper
calibration by you, third party products (i.e., hardware or software) used by you which are not intended by NI for
use with the SOFTWARE, utilization of an improper hardware or software key (if applicable), or unauthorized
maintenance of the SOFTWARE.
14. Customer Remedies. NI's sole obligation (and your sole remedy) with respect to the foregoing Limited Warranty
shall be to, at NI's option, return the fees paid by you to NI, in which event you must return or destroy all copies
of the SOFTWARE in accordance with NI's reasonable instructions, in which case the license granted to you
shall terminate without liability on the part of NI by reason of such termination, or repair or replace the
SOFTWARE, provided that NI receives written notice of applicable defects during the warranty period. You
hereby agree not to bring an action to enforce your remedies under the foregoing Limited Warranty, or for breach
of warranty, more than one (1) year after the accrual of such cause of action.
15. No Other Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, NO WARRANTIES, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR
SOFTWARE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY
ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. NI DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY
SOFTWARE, AND THE SOFTWARE SERVICES. NI DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY
REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR
SOFTWARE SERVICES IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE AND
DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE SERVICES WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.
16. Intellectual Property Liability. NI shall, at its own expense, defend any claim brought against you by a third party
resulting from your use of the SOFTWARE as authorized by your license, to the extent that such claim alleges
that the SOFTWARE infringes any patent, copyright, or trademark of such third party protected by the laws of the
U.S.A., Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, or the European Union, provided that such
claim does not arise from your use of the SOFTWARE in combination with equipment, devices, software or code
not made by NI, or from any modification of the SOFTWARE not made by NI, and further provided that you notify
NI in writing immediately upon your obtaining notice of such impending claim and that you fully cooperate with NI
in preparing a defense. If you provide to NI the authority, assistance, and information NI needs to defend or settle
such claim, NI shall pay any final award of damages or settlement with respect to such claim and any expense
you incur at NI's written request, but NI shall not be liable for a settlement made without its prior written consent.
If the SOFTWARE is held to be infringing of the rights stated above and the use thereof is enjoined NI shall, or if
NI believes the SOFTWARE may be held to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights NI may, at its option,
either (i) procure for you the right to use the SOFTWARE; (ii) replace or modify the SOFTWARE with other
software which does not infringe; or (iii) receive your return of the infringing SOFTWARE and refund to you the
license fee payment(s) made by you to NI for the SOFTWARE. NI'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECTION 16,
(INCLUDING THAT OF ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS AND ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, AND REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR SUCH LIABILITY) SHALL IN NO
EVENT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE $50,000 (U.S.), AND IN NO EVENT SHALL NI BE OBLIGATED
UNDER THIS SECTION 16 TO INCUR OR PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE, ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE
AMOUNT SET FORTH IN THIS SENTENCE. The foregoing states your sole remedy for, and NI's entire liability
and responsibility for, infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual or industrial property
right relating to the SOFTWARE. THIS LIMITED INDEMNITY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR
IMPLIED WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. THE FOREGOING OBLIGATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY
TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS INCORPORATED IN OR
OTHERWISE PROVIDED WITH THE SOFTWARE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK TO THE APPLICABLE
THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT INVOLVING
THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS.
17. Limitation On Liability. The entire liability of NI and its licensors, distributors, and suppliers (including its and their
directors, officers, employees, and agents) is set forth above. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NI AND ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND SUPPLIERS
(INCLUDING ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
KIND; ANY EXPENSES, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOST
BUSINESS INFORMATION; OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EXCEPT DIRECT DAMAGES NOT EXCEEDING IN
THE AGGREGATE THE LICENSE FEE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT INVOLVED; ARISING OUT
OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, ANY TECHNICAL
SUPPORT SERVICES RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE OR THE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR RELATED
HARDWARE, EVEN IF NI OR ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED
TO BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF NI OR OTHERS. You acknowledge that the applicable fees and prices reflect
this allocation of risk. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for
consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply. If the foregoing limitation of liability is
not enforceable because the SOFTWARE, the Third Party Software, the services, or the hardware is determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to be defective and to have directly
caused bodily injury, death, or property damage, in no event shall the aggregate liability of NI, its licensors,
distributors, and suppliers for property damage exceed the greater of $50,000 (U.S.) or the license fee paid for
the SOFTWARE.
18. Warning. (1) NI PRODUCTS ARE NOT DESIGNED WITH COMPONENTS AND TESTING FOR A LEVEL OF
RELIABILITY SUITABLE FOR USE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH SURGICAL IMPLANTS OR AS CRITICAL
COMPONENTS IN ANY LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHOSE FAILURE TO PERFORM CAN REASONABLY
BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INJURY TO A HUMAN. (2) IN ANY APPLICATION, INCLUDING
THE ABOVE, RELIABILITY OF OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CAN BE IMPAIRED BY
ADVERSE FACTORS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY, COMPUTER
HARDWARE MALFUNCTIONS, COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FITNESS, FITNESS OF
COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE USED TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION, INSTALLATION
ERRORS, SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS, MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES
OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING OR CONTROL DEVICES, TRANSIENT FAILURES OF ELECTRONIC
SYSTEMS (HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), UNANTICIPATED USES OR MISUSES, OR ERRORS ON
THE PART OF THE USER OR APPLICATIONS DESIGNER (ADVERSE FACTORS SUCH AS THESE ARE
HEREAFTER COLLECTIVELY TERMED "SYSTEM FAILURES"). ANY APPLICATION WHERE A SYSTEM
FAILURE WOULD CREATE A RISK OF HARM TO PROPERTY OR PERSONS (INCLUDING THE RISK OF
BODILY INJURY AND DEATH) SHOULD NOT BE RELIANT SOLELY UPON ONE FORM OF ELECTRONIC
SYSTEM DUE TO THE RISK OF SYSTEM FAILURE. TO AVOID DAMAGE, INJURY, OR DEATH, THE USER
OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MUST TAKE REASONABLY PRUDENT STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST
SYSTEM FAILURES, INCLUDING BACK-UP OR SHUT DOWN MECHANISMS. BECAUSE EACH END-USER
SYSTEM IS CUSTOMIZED AND DIFFERS FROM NI'S TESTING PLATFORMS AND BECAUSE A USER OR
APPLICATION DESIGNER MAY USE NI PRODUCTS IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS IN A
MANNER NOT EVALUATED OR CONTEMPLATED BY NI, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER IS
ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THE SUITABILITY OF NI PRODUCTS
WHENEVER NI PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED IN A SYSTEM OR APPLICATION, INCLUDING THE
APPROPRIATE DESIGN, PROCESS, AND SAFETY LEVEL OF SUCH SYSTEM OR APPLICATION.
19. U.S. Government Rights. The SOFTWARE is a "commercial item" developed exclusively at private expense,
consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such
terms are defined or used in the applicable U.S. acquisition regulations. If you are an agency, department, or
other entity of the United States Government, the SOFTWARE is licensed hereunder (i) only as a commercial
item and (ii) with only those rights as are granted to all other licensees pursuant to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. You agree not to use, duplicate, or disclose the SOFTWARE in any way not expressly permitted
by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement requires NI to produce or furnish technical data for or to you.
20. Compliance.
A. You agree to make all applicable records available for review by NI during your normal business hours so as
to permit NI (upon reasonable notice to you) to verify your compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Further, if you are a business or other entity, you agree that upon the request of NI or NI's
authorized representative, you will promptly document and certify in writing to NI that your and your
employees' use of the SOFTWARE complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. NI may (upon
written notice) inspect your use of the SOFTWARE during your normal business hours to ensure your
compliance with this Agreement. If the results of any such inspection indicate the underpayment by you of
applicable fees due and payable to NI, you shall (i) immediately pay such amounts to NI; and (ii) reimburse
NI for the cost of such inspection.
B. You agree that the SOFTWARE may collect and communicate certain software, hardware, and use
information to NIs (or its service providers') servers for the purposes of (i) checking for and performing any
updates, (ii) ensuring that you have complied and are complying with the terms and license conditions in this
Agreement, including your use of valid software key codes or hardware keys or both, and (iii) NI's internal
product development. The information collected and communicated does not include any proprietary
application data. NI will not provide any of the information to any third party except as required (i) by law or
legal process, or (ii) to enforce compliance with the terms and license conditions in this Agreement, including
your use of valid software key codes or hardware keys or both.
21. General.
A. If the SOFTWARE is manufactured in the Republic of Ireland, (1) (i) this Agreement is governed by the laws
of the Republic of Ireland, exclusive of any provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International
Sale of Goods, and without regard to principles of conflicts of law; and (ii) the non-exclusive venue for all
actions under this Agreement shall be in the courts located in Dublin, the Republic of Ireland and the parties
agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts; otherwise (2) (i) this Agreement is governed by the laws of
the State of Texas, U.S.A., exclusive of any provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International
Sale of Goods, and without regard to principles of conflicts of law; and (ii) the non-exclusive venue for all
actions under this Agreement shall be in the courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A. and the parties
agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.
B. This Agreement (and if applicable the VLP Documentation and the EP Documentation) constitutes the
complete agreement between you and NI regarding the SOFTWARE and supersedes any oral or written
proposals, prior agreements, purchase orders, or any other communication between you and NI relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement. If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions of this National
Instruments Software License Agreement and any applicable Specific Product Addendum, the terms and
conditions of the Specific Product Addendum shall prevail and control with respect to the SOFTWARE
product(s) to which the Specific Product Addendum applies. If there is a conflict between the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the VLP Documentation or the EP Documentation, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall prevail and control. NI's applicable standard Terms and Conditions of Sale,
the current version of which is set forth at http://www.ni.com/legal/termsofsale, shall apply as applicable with
respect to any technical support services provided as part of the Software Services, and to any Training &
Certification Services provided under an EP, provided, however that in any event the provisions of this
Agreement shall apply and control with respect to any Upgrades or other SOFTWARE which may be
provided as part of or in connection with any such services. No delay or omission by NI to exercise any right
or power it has under this Agreement shall impair or be construed as a waiver of such right or power. A
waiver by NI of any breach of any provision hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding
breach of that provision or of any breach of any other provision. No modification of this Agreement shall be
effective unless set forth in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative of you and NI. The word
"including" as used in this Agreement shall be understood as meaning "including without limitation". If you
are unable to access the internet to view any of the web pages referred to in this Agreement, you may
request the information from your local NI sales office.
C. If any action is brought by either party to this Agreement against the other regarding the subject matter
hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any relief granted, reasonable attorney
fees and court costs. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the offending clause will be modified
so as to be enforceable and, as modified, shall be fully enforced, and the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect.
D. The SOFTWARE is, and Third Party Software provided by NI with the SOFTWARE may be, subject to
control under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Part 730 et. seq.), other applicable U.S.
export control laws and regulations, and applicable global export control laws and regulations, including, for
products exported from the European Union, the Council Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009 (the "Regulation")
and the Hungarian Government Decree No. 50/2004 (III. 23.). You agree that you will not export, re-export
or transfer any SOFTWARE or Third Party Software provided by NI with the SOFTWARE via any means to
any prohibited destination, entity or individual without the required export license(s) or authorization(s) from
the U.S. Government and/or other applicable export licensing authority. NI reserves the right not to ship or
permit downloading of the SOFTWARE ordered if, at any time, NI believes that such shipment or
downloading of such SOFTWARE or any Third Party Software provided by NI with such SOFTWARE, may
violate U.S. and/or other applicable export control laws. If you are downloading the SOFTWARE, you hereby
represent and warrant to NI as follows: (i) you are not located in, or under the control of, any country the
laws and regulations of which prohibit importation of the SOFTWARE or any Third Party Software provided
by NI with the SOFTWARE; and (ii) you are not located in, or under the control of, any country to which the
laws and regulations of the U.S. and/or other applicable export control laws prohibit exportation of the
SOFTWARE or any such Third Party Software. For text of the relevant legal materials, see
